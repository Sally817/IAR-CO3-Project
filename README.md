# IAR-CO3-Project
IAR C03 final project

For our idea, we think that machine learning programs will play an important role in many shopping platforms, especially in some high level skin care fields. these industries are new to most people and not easy to understand. I believe that for many people, especially men, skin care products or cosmetics are a completely strange environment. So our application is to solve this problem and give people what they need. Machine learning can provide a full information if people can only show a image or picture to it. Basically, we use Swift code-language to support our application, it helps us to build our software together. Beyond that, We put machine translation, clouding calculating, and cloud restore to provide a better service for our user.
